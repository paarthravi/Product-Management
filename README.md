# Product-Management
This Product Management project, built using Spring Boot with an MVC architecture, enables efficient management of product data through full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). It uses Thymeleaf for the front-end and Oracle as the database, providing a seamless, user-friendly interface for managing product information.
